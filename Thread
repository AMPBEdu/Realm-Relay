[CENTER][B][SIZE=5]Realm Relay for v27.7.4+[/SIZE][/B][/CENTER]
What is this? It's an updated version of a java proxy for rotmg. It works like K_Relay, except it's coded in java/javascript.
Should you use it if your not a developer? Probably not, at the moment of posting K_Relay has more support/hacks
This is mainly for developers looking to create scripts in javascript.
